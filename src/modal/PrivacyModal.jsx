              detected on our Sites. When combined, these generate an automated
              score indicating the likelihood of a fraudulent transaction. If
              our systems indicate a high score for you, then we may decline an
              order or even block you from our services. The specific fraud
              indicators are dynamic so will change depending on what types of
