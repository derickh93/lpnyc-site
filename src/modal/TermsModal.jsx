              <h1>Dry Cleaning Damage Policy</h1>
              <p></p>
              Should an order include “dry-clean” items, it is the customer’s
              responsibility to (i) physically place such items in a dedicated
              bag (separated from the regular laundry); (ii) select the “quick
              order dry clean” option in the shopping cart when placing the
              order; and (iii) make reference in the commentary section as to
              which bag contains the dry clean garments. Failure to do so might
              cause dry-clean garments to be laundered and damaged in the
              process. While our washing team does its best to identify such
              items and sort them, WashClub will not be held responsible. At
              WashClub, we use the utmost care in processing articles entrusted
              to us. Through our years of experience and extensive knowledge, we
              use processes, which we believe are best suited to the nature and
              condition of each individual article. However, damages may
              inevitably occur. Nevertheless, we cannot assume responsibility
              for inherent weaknesses or defects in materials that are not
              readily apparent prior to processing. This applies particularly,
              but not exclusively, to suedes, leathers, silks, satins,
              double-faced fabrics, vinyls, polyurethanes, lace, etc.
              Responsibility also is disclaimed for trimmings, buckles, beads,
              buttons, bells and sequins. WashClub is not responsible for
              garments with inherent manufacturer defects or mislabeling of
              cleaning procedure. Claims for damaged items must be reported
              within 48 hours from the time of pick up or delivery, accompanied
              by the ticket and receipt or proof of purchase. Reimbursement
              therein will be issued in accordance to the appraised value of
              each damaged item by following the International Fair Claims Guide
              for Consumer Textile Products as set forth by the International
              Fabricare Institute, and shall not exceed more than ten times our
              charge for cleaning the item. Lost Item Policy Every measure is
              taken to ensure there is no loss of personal property. However, in
              the rare instance that items are missing, a claim must be
              submitted within 48 hours from the time of pick up or delivery,
              along with a receipt or proof of purchase and the delivery ticket.
              Reimbursement (preferably in the form of store credit) will amount
              to the lower of: 10 times our charge for cleaning the item;
              Replacement value of the garment(s). 50% if purchase made under 3
              months, 25% from 3-6 months and 10% after 6 months of purchase.
              Receipt(s) must be furnished upon request. Although our staff is
              trained to meticulously examine each garment for private property
              and valuables left inside garments, WashClub is not responsible
              for any of such missing items. According to New York State law, we
              cannot hold unclaimed garments for more than 30-days. Beyond this
              period, unclaimed garments will be donated to charity accordingly.
              <h1>Wash & Fold Policy</h1>
              By using our services or placing an order through the mobile
              application, website, or phone you agree to the following terms:
              Reimbursements for lost or damaged items tendered through our Wash
              & Fold laundering service may be issued if a detailed list of each
              item is accompanied with the order at the time of drop off. The
              list must include the brand, item style, color and size of each
              individual item in the order. The value of the reimbursement for
              Wash & Fold services shall not exceed more than 10 times our
              charge for cleaning the order, preferably in the form of store
              credits. If no list is provided at the time of drop off, WashClub
              is not responsible for any lost or damaged items and there will be
              NO REIMBURSEMENTS or compensation of any form. WashClub does all
              laundry in state-of-the-art commercial-grade washing machines and
              therefore does not take "Hand washing" instructions. Items
              requiring "hand washing" must be clearly separated and labeled by
              the customer and they will be washed using a "gentle cycle".
              WashClub denies any responsibility if the garments are damaged in
              the process, given the unique nature of such garments. All prices
              on the website or mobile application are estimates based on the
              weight you enter and may be subject to change based upon WashClub
              policy or accurate weight measurements. Should an order include an
              infestation we charge $2.49/lb. Should an order include “air dry”
              or “low dry” items, it is the customer’s responsibility to (i)
              physically place such items in a dedicated bag (separated from the
              regular laundry); (ii) select the “low dry/air dry” option in the
              shopping cart when placing the order; and (iii) make reference in
              the commentary section as to which bag contains the “low dry”
              garments. Failure to do so might cause such garments to get dried
              on standard high temperature and get damaged in the process. While
              our washing team does its best to identify such items and sort
              them, WashClub will not be held responsible.
