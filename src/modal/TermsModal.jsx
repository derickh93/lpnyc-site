<span>7.2 If you are not available to accept redelivery of Items, we will contact you by phone or email to arrange redelivery at your convenience.</span>
<span>7.3 If delivery is not possible due to the customer being unavailable at the designated time, a redelivery charge of $5.00 will be charged for each consequent attempt of delivery. Laundry Pickup Day will make efforts to find a suitable redelivery time.</span>
<span>7.4 If you have failed to accept or arrange redelivery of an Item for more than 90 days after the redelivery date specified in the Order we may dispose of the Item or donate it to an accredited charity of Laundry Pickup Day’s choice.</span>

<span>7.7 You may, by written instructions to us, request Us to leave an Item in an agreed location without providing Us with an acknowledgement. If you do so, it is at Our discretion and entirely at your own risk, and we shall not be liable to you for any damage or loss of Items re-delivered on this basis.</span>
<span>7.8 You are responsible for ensuring that we and/or our contractors have such access (including free parking facilities) as may be reasonably required to carry out the Services.</span>

<span>8.1 We will provide the Services with reasonable care and skill in accordance with good industry standards.</span>
<span>8.2 We will not be liable for any delay or non-performance of our Services where you have failed to provide accurate information in your Order, for example if an address is incomplete or inaccurate, or if you fail to accept redelivery of Items in accordance with an order</span>
<span>8.3 We will not be liable for any Items submitted to us that have an increased risk of damage, including, but not limited to, Items:</span>
<span>8.3.1 with special requirements or instructions for cleaning;</span>
<span>8.3.2 with no label indicating cleaning instructions;</span>
<span>8.3.3 which are damaged or stained; and</span>
<span>8.3.4 bearing an extraneous or hazardous thing, e.g., pins, jewelry, coins, pens, etc.</span>
<span>and at our discretion and with your consent may agree to provide the Services at your risk in respect of those Items.</span>
<span>8.4 Wash and Tumble Dry Orders</span>
<span>8.4.1 Checking Items</span>
<span>Please ensure to thoroughly check all the garments for hazardous items e.g. coins, pens, keys, etc. as we hold no responsibility for any items lost or damaged as a result of the cleaning process.</span>
<span>8.4.2 Washing and Drying Process</span>
<span>The load is washed at a 30 degree celsius cycle and tumble dried at a medium heat. As we process a high volume we might not always be able to cater to personal requirements (e.g. temperature, washing powders, etc.). Please note that the items are not ironed.</span>
<span>8.4.3 Color Separation</span>
<span>We will separate the clothes into lights and darks for you. Although we will take the utmost care in doing this, we will accept no responsibility if there is any bleeding or color transfer during the cleaning process.</span>
<span>8.4.4 Size of Bag</span>
<span>We will measure the laundry by weight. The minimum weight is 15lbs . We will update this after we have weighed it at the facility. Any orders below 15lbs will be charged at the Wash, Tumble Dry & Fold price.</span>
<span>8.4.5 Damaged Items</span>
<span>We will not be liable for damage to items, as we wash by the load and do not inspect the care labels of each garment. For garments that need to be specially treated i.e. leather, silk, cashmere, fur, velvet and other delicate garments, please ensure that these items can be machine washed and tumble dried.</span>
<span>8.4.6 Tagging</span>
<span>Laundry items are tagged by the load and not individually tagged. Therefore, we cannot accept any liability for missing items.</span>
<span>9. If there is a problem with the services</span>
<span>9.1 If there is any problem with the Services:</span>
<span>9.1.1 please contact our Customer Service by email at laundrypickupnyc@gmail.com as detailed on the App and tell Us as soon as reasonably possible;</span>
<span>You will not have to pay for Us to deal with your complaint.</span>
<span>9.2 Complaints should be notified to Us within 24 hours of redelivery of any Item if you believe that We are in breach of our obligations under these Terms.</span>
<span>9.3 As a consumer, you have statutory rights if our Services are not carried out with reasonable skill and care, or if the materials used are faulty or not as described. Advice about your legal rights is available from your local Citizens’ Advice Bureau or Trading Standards office. Nothing in these Terms will affect these legal rights.</span>
<span>10. Price and payment</span>
<span>10.1 The price of the Services will be set out in Our price list as set out in the App or at www.laundrypickupday.com/prices and will be the price in force at the time you place your Order. Our prices may change at any time, but price changes will not affect Orders that We have accepted in accordance with paragraph 3.2 or 4.3</span>
<span>10.2 We reserve the right to charge a Service Fee, which may be subject to change, for the provision of our Services. You will be notified of any applicable Service Fee and taxes prior to purchase on the checkout page on our Application.</span>
<span>10.3 Upon placing an Order we capture the payment but do not directly charge your card, although some banks will show it as a recent transaction. We process payments when we have received your Order at the facility and after cleaning. If your final total is greater than your captured total (i.e. we need to update your Order accordingly) it may show on your recent transactions, but the captured amount will be released when we have taken the full payment. We will take payment from the debit or credit card, details of which were supplied with your Order. If for any reason we are unable to take payment, you will become liable to Us for the sum due plus interest at the rate 3% a year above the base lending rate of Barclays Bank PLC from time to time. Interest will accrue on a daily basis from due date until the date of actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. You must pay Us interest together with any overdue amount.</span>
<span>11. Our liability to you</span>
<span>11.1 In the unlikely event of loss or damage to an item, Laundry Pickup Day will pay compensation in line with the Fair Compensation Guidelines as provided by the Textile Services Association. The TSA guidelines indicate that fair and reasonable compensation be paid on the basis of an allowance for wear and tear and the age of the Item. It is considered reasonable for Us to ask for receipts, bank or credit card statements confirming the purchase price prior to agreeing any compensation. If found liable, We will follow the TSA guidelines. The compensation given will not include extra costs to purchase the Item, including but not limited to shipping costs, tailoring/altering costs, etc.</span>
<span>11.1.1 Our total liability to you in respect of each Item is limited to ten times the price we charge for the Services, but not more than $50.00 per item, given a proof of purchase is provided, showing the date of purchase and the value of the item.</span>
<span>11.1.2 You must inspect the Items following delivery, and if you believe that Items are lost or damaged, you must inform Us about such loss or damage within 48 hours of receiving the Items. We reserve the right to inspect and take pictures of any alleged damage to any Items.</span>
<span>11.1.3 We will not be responsible for any damage to items which.</span>
<span>(a) do not have the original dry-cleaning ticket attached;</span>
<span>(b) were not submitted for inspection; or</span>

<span>11.4.2 the fact that the Item has no label indicating cleaning instructions;</span>
<span>11.4.3 any existing damage to the Item at the time of collection;</span>

We will always try to position these as inconspicuous as possible. We strongly advise you not to remove these stickers, as We cannot accept liability for any damage caused by removal by you or a third party.
